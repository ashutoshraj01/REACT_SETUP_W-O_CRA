- Linters can speed up developer productivity by providing essential real-time feedback during the development process as issues arise.
- Common coding standards can be applied throughout the entire team or organization making cooperation and expectations more transparent and efficient.
- Linters can help detect and identify code patterns that could possibly lead to security vulnerabilities.
